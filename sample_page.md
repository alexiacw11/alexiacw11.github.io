## Swire Coca-Cola Capstone Project
For this project, I was in a group with three other women. Our semester-long project concluded with a live, 20-minute presentation to Swire Coca-Colaâ€™s Director of Data Science and other employees.

### GitHub Repositories 
There are two repositories from this experience, one that contains my findings and the repository we handed over to the company. With that said, the group findings are where our presentation and other deliverables can be found. Feel free to access my work [here](https://github.com/alexiacw11/Alexia-sSwireRepo/tree/main) and the group repository [here](https://github.com/leahekblad/MSBA-Capstone-Group-1).

**Project description:** 
Swire Coca-Cola (SCUU) was interested in optimizing logistics by transitioning customers selling below a specific annual volume to an Alternate Route to Market (ARTM) or white truck delivery. This is intended to reduce delivery costs and improve operational efficiency. However, this approach poses a risk: some customers on the ARTM list may have the potential to exceed this volume threshold (and become very high volume Customers) through the organic growth of their business, or with active support from SCCU. Moving these growth-ready, or high-growth-potential customers to ARTM prematurely could hinder SCCU revenue growth and long-term business opportunities because they would not have the same level of contact with Customers using ARTM.

Sales data suggests certain customers currently selling below the threshold share characteristics with high-performing accounts, indicating untapped potential. For example, the business thinks that *** gallons annually is the right threshold for customers who are local market partners and buy only fountain drinks but no CO2, cans, or bottles. However, is *** gallons truly the optimal threshold? Could a better number be determined statistically to balance cost efficiency with revenue growth opportunities? Are there other characteristics/Customer attributes that should be considered? 

### Key Questions
To address this, SCCU must leverage historical sales data, customer profiles, and other customer interaction data to identify key growth indicators. By differentiating low-potential from high-potential accounts, the company can ensure that promising customers remain on direct delivery routes, and that sales are maximized. This strategy will balance cost-efficiency with growth, safeguarding future revenue opportunities while maintaining a strong foundation for long-term business success. Specifically, the following Business Questions must be answered:

1. What factors or characteristics distinguish customers with annual sales exceeding the determined volume threshold from those below this threshold?
2. How can Swire Coca-Cola use historical sales data, or other Customer Characteristics to predict which ARTM customers have the potential to grow beyond the volume threshold annually?
3. How can these insights be integrated into the routing strategy to support long-term growth while maintaining logistical efficiency?
4. What levers can be employed to accelerate volume and share growth at growth-ready, high-potential customers?
